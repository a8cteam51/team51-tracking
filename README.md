Automatically opts site into WooCommerce Usage Tracking

This plugin would work well as an mu-plugin that is auto-loaded into new sites upon site creation.

The option update runs any time a plugin, theme, or core finishes updating as an easy way to have it run periodically without slowing down a site.
